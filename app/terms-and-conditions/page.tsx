          Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
          of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of these
          Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
          limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service. To the
          maximum extent permitted by applicable Indian law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of

          of liability for certain types of damages, which means that some of
          the above limitations may not apply. In such cases, the liability of
          the Company and its suppliers will be limited to the greatest extent
          permitted by applicable Indian law.
